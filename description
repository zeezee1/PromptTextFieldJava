PrompTextField api is created using the interface "FocusListener" on JTextfields to create promptText/Placeholder/hint in java library Javax.Swing..
This prompt text property is now available in "swingx" libaray but swingx library is a bit slower than javax.swing library as it is newer with new properties. So if someone wants to use placeholder/hint in javax.swing library then it will be very helpful
IN MyClass file there are a few example of how e can use this PromptTextfield class.
